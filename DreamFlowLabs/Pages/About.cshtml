				<strong>Dreamflow Labs</strong> is a creative technology studio exploring how 
				artificial intelligence can inspire calm, reflection, and imagination. 
				We design emotionally intelligent experiences that help people rest, reflect, 
				and reconnect through story and sound.

				Our flagship product, <strong>Dreamflow AI</strong>, brings the tagline 
				<em>“Moshi meets Sora”</em> to life — blending soothing narrative, 
				adaptive visuals, and AI‑driven personalization to create nightly stories 
				that evolve with each listener.

				Founded in 2025, our mission is simple:  
				to make technology not just smarter, but gentler —  
				bringing creativity, empathy, and serenity into people’s daily lives.

				From research in generative storytelling to advances in ambient AI, 
				Dreamflow Labs continues to experiment at the intersection of 
				art, science, and emotion — shaping the future of mindful technology, one dream at a time.
