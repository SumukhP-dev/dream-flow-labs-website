		<h4>🌿 Why This Matters</h4>
		<p>
			Mental health research has incredible potential to improve lives, but too often it remains 
			locked in academic journals. We believe that understanding, compassion, and practical wisdom 
			should be accessible to everyone. By combining rigorous research with creative storytelling, 
			thoughtful reflection, and meaningful conversation, we're creating a space where mental health 
			knowledge meets daily life — where science supports well-being, and innovation serves humanity.
		</p>
		<p>
			Join us in exploring how research, creativity, and calm technology can come together 
			to support mental wellness and mindful living in our modern world.
